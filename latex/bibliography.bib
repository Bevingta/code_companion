abstract = {Amidst the rapid development of the software industry and the burgeoning open-source culture, vulnerability detection within the software security domain has emerged as an ever-expanding area of focus. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly the notable progress in deep learning for pattern recognition and natural language processing, has catalyzed a surge in research endeavors exploring the integration of deep learning for the enhancement of vulnerability detection techniques. In this paper, we investigate contemporary deep learning-based source code analysis methods, with a concentrated emphasis on those pertaining to static code vulnerability detection. We categorize these methods based on various representations of source code employed during the preprocessing stage, including token-based and graph-based representations of source code, and further subdivided based on the types of deep learning algorithms or graph representations employed. We summarize the basic processes of model training and vulnerability detection under these different representation formats. Furthermore, we explore the limitations inherent in current approaches and provide insights into future trends and challenges for research in this field.}
