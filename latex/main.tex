\section*{Abstract}
This paper presents an example of a properly formatted academic document with multiple authors and sections. We demonstrate the integration of citations, formatting, and structural elements common in academic papers.

\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we explore various aspects of academic writing and formatting. The structure and organization of academic papers play a crucial role in effectively communicating research findings \cite{Abril07}. 


/subsection{Data}
There are two sources of data which we have been exploring. The first of these is the 
DiverseVul dataset. This dataset contains a large number of vulnerabilities written in C/C++.
These have been split into two categories: those which contain vulnerabilities and those
where vulnerabilities are not present. In the vulnerabilities present category, there are 
281,000 files, and in the vulnerabilities not present category, there are around 50,000
examples of code. For each of these examples, there is a certain ammount of data. Each entry
contains the code snippet itself (in most cases a large chunk of code), the commit message, and if there is one then the vulnerability code which is present.
