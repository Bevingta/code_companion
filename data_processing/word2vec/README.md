# Word2Vec

Find the pre-trained Word2Vec model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10cnV3YzKX3n9LYNSvpDRwUyLoSFaGa40). \
The Word2Vec model was trained on the entire train dataset, which was tokenized by code in [word2vec_geneeration.py](./word2vec_generation.py). \
All words in code were forced to lowercase for uniformity. \
An example of how to use the model can be found in [using_word2vec_model_example.py](./using_word2vec_model_example.py).
