abstract = {We collected a large C/C++ code vulnerability dataset from open-source Github projects, namely Big-Vul. We crawled the public Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database and CVE-related source code repositories. Specifically, we collected the descriptive information of the vulnerabilities from the CVE database, e.g., CVE IDs, CVE severity scores, and CVE summaries. With the CVE information and its related published Github code repository links, we downloaded all of the code repositories and extracted vulnerability related code changes. In total, Big-Vul contains 3,754 code vulnerabilities spanning 91 different vulnerability types. All these code vulnerabilities are extracted from 348 Github projects. All information is stored in the CSV format. We linked the code changes with the CVE descriptive information. Thus, our Big-Vul can be used for various research topics, e.g., detecting and fixing vulnerabilities, analyzing the vulnerability related code changes. Big-Vul is publicly available on Github.},
